# ILLC PhD thesis template

This is a copy of the
[ILLC Dissertation Style](https://www.illc.uva.nl/PhDProgramme/current-candidates/other/illcdiss.html)
with some adjustments and scripts.

Please read the `Makefile` to get an idea what is included.
You should have a recent version of LaTeX.
In particular, you should have
  [biber](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/) installed.
Also useful are:
  [diffpdf](http://www.qtrac.eu/diffpdf.html),
  [pdftk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) and
  [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

The folder `tools` contains the programs
  [check_repeats](http://www.grapenthin.org/toolbox/check_repeats.html) and
  [ppdflatex](https://github.com/stefanhepp/pplatex).
  You might have to recompile them or install their dependencies.
